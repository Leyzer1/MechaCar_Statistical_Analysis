## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
Two variables have non-random varience: The ground clearence and the vehicle lenght. Both have a high significance because both have a small p-valu-es. 

- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero because the independent variables had an effect in the dependent variables in the linear regression.

- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
To see if the linear model see is effective we look at the r-square value. The r-square is 0.7149 which indicates thatr out of 100 insatnces, the model can predict the mpg of the MechCar about 71 times. With this result we can say the model is effective.
